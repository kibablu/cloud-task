# Include all modules/resources by sourcing other .tf files
# No resource definitions hereâ€”keeps main.tf as the entry point

# Optionally, you may add remote state, backend, or provider blocks here if needed.

# Example backend configuration (uncomment if using remote state):
# terraform {
#   backend "gcs" {
#     bucket  = "my-tf-state-bucket"
#     prefix  = "prod/state"
#   }
# }
